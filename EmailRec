1.Email providers usually have duration in which inactive users are removed and the account name becomes available once again when creating new accounts.

2.This can lead to problems when websites, forums, games, etc.. use email recovery for accounts.

3.If you know that an email has been used on some kind of forum and see that the email is not currently registered -> You can register it and steal the forum account 
by using the recovery button on the forum and it is sent to the email you registered.

4.This can be harmful if someone has access to your forum account and they can impersonate you or read private messages.
